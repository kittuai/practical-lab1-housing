##  Project Description

This project applies **univariate linear regression** to predict housing prices in California. Using a single feature at a time, the goal is to understand which variable best explains variations in median house value. The features tested include:

- Median Income  
- Population  
- Number of Households

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R² score.

##  Summary

Among the three features tested, **Median Income** showed the strongest correlation with house prices and gave the best predictive results in the linear regression model.
